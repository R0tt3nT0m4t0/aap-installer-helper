== Installation Notes

IMPORTANT: The following documents the procedures I follow to install AAP in multiple ways in my local environment where I run Virtual Machines using KVM without network or firewall restrictions. Take that into consideration before running the code as is. 

These repository covers:

- Containerized Installation of AAP 2.5 growth topology in a single machine
- RPM Installation of AAP 2.5 growth topology with the smaller possible footprint of 6 VMs

In the future:

- Containerized Installation of AAP 2.5 enterprise topology with managed database
- Containerized Installation of AAP 2.5 enterprise topology with external database
- RPM Installation of AAP 2.5 enterprise topology with managed database
- RPM Installation of AAP 2.5 enterprise topology with external database
